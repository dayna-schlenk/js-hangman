// ------------------------
// MVP Requirements
// ------------------------
// User starts with 10 lives
// Generate random word (start with an array of basic words)
// Empty spaces to populate letters in random mystery word
// ABC letter buttons for user to select (which will then either populate the correct letter in the proper place, or take away 1 life from the user if incorrect)
// Game ends when either the user runs out of lives or the word is guessed correctly
// Button shows up to either play again or quit


// ------------------------
// Next Steps
// ------------------------
// Print a random word from an array to the console
// User clicks on a letter-button, and an "I've been clicked" message appears for all buttons
    // User clicks on a letter-button, console indicates which letter was clicked
